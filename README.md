# Web-Programming-Final

Goal
Produce a text based game featuring exploration and combat

Requirements
Final project for Dr. Ohl's Web Programming Class. 
Update requirements once we get exactly what he wants, but for now we know he wants us to use 2 servers and a database.
Encrypt user data when it is transferred between server and user.
Need authentication method

Ideas
Database table with classes
Combine text based commands ("go", find", "open") with button input. Look to early final fantasy, old mmorpg. turn based.
no art, most is you win or you died.

Main theme and design
Bottom in combat has buttins, outside is text. 
Top has xp bar, wealth/score, name, username, stats
Use point values for hp, stamina, possibly shift color value with lower values
Danger level/enviornmental effects.
Text changes color when entering combat?
Use score to level up? 1 life game, every time 

Servers
1-Entities (event checking)
2-Loot
